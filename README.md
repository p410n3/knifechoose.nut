kc.nut
---------------

VScript to use all Knife models on a local server.
Thanks to Phillip L.(p410n3) for forking the project and adding some awesome functions to the script. I really hope we will work together to improve it even more.

Installation and Usage
---------------

The kc.nut needs to be placed in "<your csgo directory>/csgo/scripts/vscripts"

To run it in-game start a local server (for example 'Offline with Bots') and write "script_execute kc"
in your console. Then you can:

* Press INS (or Insert) on your keyboard to choose a Knife
* Press DEL (or Delete) on your keyboard to equip the chosen Knife
* Press END (or End) at every Roundstart to actually load the Script again. (It resets every Round)

You don't know which Keys I am talking about? I mean these, above your arrowkeys:

ToDo List:
* Add a little menu
* an AutoBind feature that makes it more convenient to give you the knife at every round start

Some things Phillip added:

* Removed sv_cheats 1 as it's not needed anymore
* Removed some not really necessary Functions
* Added a system that allows the Script to be controlled with Keys instead of the console
* Auto Setup of the Script for the First Round
